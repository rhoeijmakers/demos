# Hugo framework

I build this demo website with Hugo. That is a framework that builds a static website from Markdown and/or HTMl-files. In order for this to work I had to install it on my Mac and then find a template to layout the content. With this you can build your site locally and then commit to Github. I then connected Github with Netlify which builds and publishes the site to the web.
